# Blackjack Advisor
Welcome.
blackjack_advisor.rb mimics the game Blackjack. You are given two cards and you
know the upcard. You must tell the program the first two cards and the dealer's
upcard in order to advise the most optimal action for the player to take. It
stores the set of optimal moves for a 1 deck blackjack hand, asks the user for
his or her current hand (and the dealer's up card), and then give the user his
or her optimal move.

The program remains unifinished. The program contains one mega-hash that
requires a lot of input. It was my birthday when I created this program. I
believe no one should have to work on their birthday. What else is it for?
